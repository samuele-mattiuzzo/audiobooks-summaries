# Atomic Habits - James Clear

*Habit* : automatic response to a situation, routine. 

- same habits lead to same results
- better habit lead to **BETTER** results

To change habits, we have to **start small**

## The power of atomic habits

*The 1% rule* : small improvements can accumulate over time

- 1% better each day for 1 year -> 37 times better
- 1% worse each day for 1 year -> near or back to square 0

^ *small improvements* vs *minor setbacks*

*Success* : it's about daily habits, not the 1-off overnight change. **DO MY HABITS PUT ME ON THE PATH TO SUCCESS?**

- small changes accumulate potential, *lead to breakthrough*

- forming new habits / breaking old ones : **plateau of potential**
